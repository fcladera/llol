Open rviz using the config in `launch/llol.rviz`

First run ouster driver
```
roslaunch ouster_decoder driver.launch
```

Then run ouster decoder
```
roslaunch ouster_decoder decoder.launch
```

Then run odom
```

You may also check our [Github Action build
file](https://github.com/versatran01/llol/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yaml) for instructions on how to build LLOL in Ubuntu 20.04 with ROS Noetic.

To run multithread and show timing every 5s do
```
roslaunch llol llol.launch tbb:=1 log:=5
```

This is the open-source version, some advanced features may be missing.
